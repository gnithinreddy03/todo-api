The best place to start is with the **Authentication API**. Here’s why and how to proceed:

### 1. **Start with the Authentication API**
   - **Purpose**: It will handle user authentication, providing secure access and token management, which is essential before integrating other services.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Create endpoints for user registration, login, and token generation (e.g., JWT).
     - Include role-based access control if needed, allowing flexibility for users with different access levels.

### 2. **Implement the Student API**
   - **Purpose**: Manages student data, providing endpoints to create, update, and retrieve students.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Define REST endpoints for CRUD operations for student records.
     - Integrate with the Authentication API to ensure secure access using tokens, making sure only authenticated users can access these endpoints.

### 3. **Set Up the Todo API**
   - **Purpose**: Provides functionality for managing todos, linking each to a specific student.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Build CRUD operations for todos, associating each todo with a student’s unique ID.
     - Integrate with both the Authentication and Student APIs, using tokens for secure access and linking each todo to the appropriate student.

### 4. **Combine the Microservices with API Gateway**
   - **Purpose**: The API Gateway will act as a single entry point, routing requests to the appropriate service.
   - **Setup**:
     - Configure routes in the API Gateway for each microservice.
     - Implement load balancing and centralize authentication (so requests to all services pass through the gateway).
     - Ensure secure communication between microservices, potentially adding an additional layer of security such as service-to-service authentication.

Starting with Authentication ensures secure access from the beginning, and then adding Student and Todo services lets you gradually build functionality. Would you like guidance on setting up the Authentication API first?
